# Simple TinyMCE Writer

A lightweight, open‑source TinyMCE writing app built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a focused writing space with autosave, word count, and one‑click HTML export.

## About
Simple TinyMCE Writer is a clean, browser‑based editor for quick notes and long‑form drafts. It runs entirely in the browser (no build step), stores drafts in localStorage, and keeps the UI minimal so you can focus on writing. It’s designed as a small, hackable starter you can extend with your own toolbar, plugins, and storage backends.
